			     &nbsp;Founded at the University of Minnesota in 1904, Theta Tau is the oldest and largest professional fraternity in the field of engineering. Over 30,000 have been initiated over the years. With emphasis on quality and a strong fraternal bond, the Fraternity has chapters only at ABET accredited schools. Theta Tau carefully follows a program in the selection and development of its members that stresses the importance of high professional ethics and exemplary practices. Within each chapter, the Fraternity stimulates professional activity and social compatibility; provides a framework for group participation in campus, community, engineering, and fraternity affairs; and promotes lasting friendships - a lifetime of brotherhood in an engineering environment. The Fraternity presents awards for outstanding personal and chapter achievements. Through visitation from national officers and other alumni, the stability of each chapter can be maintained. Guidance and publications are provided by the Central Office to help manage the chapter in a professional manner. Through national conferences and conventions, there is an annual opportunity to associate with fraternity brothers (students and alumni) from chapters across the nation. We are always looking for motivated, ambitious, and energetic engineering students that are interested in building friendships, improving their professional lives, and becoming the strong foundation upon which the fraternity is built. Are you the person we are looking for?
