	<div id = "mission">
			     &nbsp;&nbsp;Founded at the University of Minnesota in 1904, Theta Tau is the oldest and largest professional fraternity in the field of engineering. Over 30,000 have been initiated over the years. With emphasis on quality and a strong fraternal bond, the Fraternity has chapters only at ABET accredited schools. Theta Tau carefully follows a program in the selection and development of its members that stresses the importance of high professional ethics and exemplary practices. Within each chapter, the Fraternity stimulates professional activity and social compatibility; provides a framework for group participation in campus, community, engineering, and fraternity affairs; and promotes lasting friendships - a lifetime of brotherhood in an engineering environment. The Fraternity presents awards for outstanding personal and chapter achievements. Through visitation from national officers and other alumni, the stability of each chapter can be maintained. Guidance and publications are provided by the Central Office to help manage the chapter in a professional manner. Through national conferences and conventions, there is an annual opportunity to associate with fraternity brothers (students and alumni) from chapters across the nation. We are always looking for motivated, ambitious, and energetic engineering students that are interested in building friendships, improving their professional lives, and becoming the strong foundation upon which the fraternity is built. Are you the person we are looking for?

	<div id = "localhistory">
	 Every great organization has a beginning, and for the Omicron Gamma Chapter at the University of California at Davis, the beginning was a modest one. It started on April 24th, 2004 when a small group of ambitious electrical engineers, later known as the Founding Fathers, met together to prepare for their upcoming IEEE elections. This group initially consisted of the individuals Hoang Do, Christopher Lee, Binh Nguyen, Jeff Sheng, Xuong Tran, and Andy Tzou and were later joined by Brothers Felix Chan, Eric Chen, Ryan Iwahashi, Trang Le, Devin Lu, Michael Moon and Jenna Nguyen, each character epitomizing the most desired ideals of any good leader: charisma, commitment, initiative, and passion, among others. The Founding Fathers realized that our university previously had no student organization on campus that encompassed the diverse engineering student body and saw an opportunity to create something great. What began as a desire to start a small organization to help not only student engineers of a specific field but also the greater student engineering community became something bigger. Through extensive research, the name Theta Tau emerged, and became the Omicron Gamma Chapter on April 29, 2007. To this day, our UC Davis Chapter of Theta Tau is ever growing with strong members who share the same resilience as the Founding Fathers of our chapter. We will not forget what we have been through to get where we are today while we strive forward into the future of many great things to come.
