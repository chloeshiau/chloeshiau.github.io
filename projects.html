			<div class="projdesc">My partner and I built a quarter-long virtual machine program in C++. The first addition dealt with single-threading multi-threading by implementing when the threads should sleep(wait) and when they should be ready/running. The second dealt with threads acquiring mutexes and the third dealt with shared memory + memory pools. The last addition dealt with reading a FAT16 image into the machine. We wrote functions to be able to deal with directories and files from the VM into the machine. </div>
